You can secure your Config Server in any way that makes sense to you (from physical network security to OAuth2 bearer tokens), because Spring Security and Spring Boot offer support for many security arrangements.

To use the default Spring Boot-configured HTTP Basic security, include Spring Security on the classpath (for example, through `spring-boot-starter-security`).
The default is a username of `user` and a randomly generated password. A random password is not useful in practice, so we recommend you configure the password (by setting `spring.security.user.password`) and encrypt it (see below for instructions on how to do that).
