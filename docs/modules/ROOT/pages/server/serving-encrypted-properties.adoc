Sometimes you want the clients to decrypt the configuration locally, instead of doing it in the server.
In that case, if you provide the `encrypt.*` configuration to locate a key, you can still have `/encrypt` and `/decrypt` endpoints, but you need to explicitly switch off the decryption of outgoing properties by placing `spring.cloud.config.server.encrypt.enabled=false` in `bootstrap.[yml|properties]`.
If you do not care about the endpoints, it should work if you do not configure either the key or the enabled flag.
