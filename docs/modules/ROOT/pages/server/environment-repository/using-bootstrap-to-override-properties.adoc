= Using Bootstrap To Override Properties
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

If you enable xref:client.adoc#config-first-bootstrap[config first bootstrap], you can let client settings override configuration from the config server by placing two properties within
the application's configuration that reside in the external environment repository (for example, Git, Vault, SVN, and others) used by the config server.

[source,properties]
----
spring.cloud.config.allowOverride=true
spring.cloud.config.overrideNone=true
----

With Bootstrap enabled and these two properties set to true you will be able to override configuration from the config server
within the clients application configuration.
