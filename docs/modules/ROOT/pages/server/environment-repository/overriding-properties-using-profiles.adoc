= Overriding Properties Using Profiles
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

The final way to override properties coming from the config server is to specify them in profile specific configuration file within the client
application.

For example, if you have the following configuration from the config server

[source,properties]
----
hello="Hello From Config Server!"
----

You can override the value of `hello` in the client application by setting `hello` in a profile specific configuration file and
then enabling that profile.

.application-overrides.properties
[source,properties]
----
hello="Hello From Application!"
----

In the above example you would have to enable the `overrides` profile.
